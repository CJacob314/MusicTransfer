# MusicTransfer

**MusicTransfer** is a small project I am making to familiarize myself with [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) and the [JFoeniX](http://www.jfoenix.com/) material design library for it.

Its functionality will eventually include the abilities to:
* browse the [TIDAL](https://tidal.com/) database for songs, albums, or playlists through search functionality as well as integration with one's personal account
* download above audio files in the high quality [FLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/) codec

It is <ins>not</ins> meant to
* replace any music player (such as TIDAL's desktop application or [Roon](https://roonlabs.com/))
* stream or integrate with WASAPI
* be anything other than just a tiny fun side project

## Installation of the Executable

I will soon add pre-compiled executables (probably `.jar` files) to the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/CJacob314/MusicTransfer/releases) page.
